## Reporting a Vulnerability

VegStyle CIO is committed to maintaining the highest standards of data integrity and security. If you discover a security vulnerability in any of our projects, we appreciate your help in disclosing it to us in a responsible manner.

**Please do not open a public GitHub issue for security vulnerabilities.**

Instead, please send a detailed report to our security team:

- **Email**: [security@vegstyle.org.uk](mailto:security@vegstyle.org.uk)
- **Encryption**: If you wish to encrypt your communication, please contact us at the email above to request our PGP public key.

### What to include in your report:
- A clear and concise description of the vulnerability.
- Step-by-step instructions to reproduce the issue (PoC).
- Potential impact and suggested mitigation, if known.

### Our Commitment:
- **Acknowledgement**: We will acknowledge receipt of your report within 48 hours.
- **Transparency**: We will provide an estimated timeline for a fix and keep you updated on the progress.
- **Recognition**: We value the contribution of security researchers and, upon request, will offer public credit for your discovery once the vulnerability is resolved.

Thank you for helping us keep the VegStyle community and its supporters safe.
